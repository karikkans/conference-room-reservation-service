A lightweight microservice designated to reserve conference room for a given number of participants and time slots.
- The application maintains the record of rooms which the user can book (configured in master table).
- It keeps the schedules of room maintenance (configured in application properties).
- The service looks for a suitable room for the number of participants (optimal) on a first-come first-serve (FCFS) basis considering
  the existing reservations and the maintenance schedule.
- The service provides a feature of viewing the available rooms for a given time slot

## Assumptions
- The booking can be done only during an allowed period. Values are configurable and read from application yaml.\
  &nbsp; Refer to <b>reservation.minimumStartTime</b> in application yaml\
  &nbsp; Refer to <b>reservation.maximumEndTime</b> in application yaml
- Dates are not considered in the APIs as the requirement is to reserve conference room for the current date.

## Implementation Details
- The reservation APIs can be with or without authorization based on the security flag configured in application yaml.\
  &nbsp; - Refer to <b>app.security.enabled</b> in application yaml\
  &nbsp; - If security is enabled, then reservation APIs can be invoked only after user registration.\
  &nbsp; - /sign-up API should be invoked to register first and then use the token (bearer) in registration APIs.\
  &nbsp; - /login API can be used to generate fresh token in order to invoke APIs in case of token expiry.
- Master table data is insert into the table using application start up (Refer to data.sql file in src/main/resources)
- The combination of room id, start and end time are taken as a unique key in reservation table to ensure the consistency of reservation
